# Python wheels

This is a Git LFS repository for storing Python wheels.  They can be easily
generated by running the following command:

```bash
docker run \
  -it --rm \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v $(pwd):/build python:3.9.13-alpine3.15 \
  /build/tools/build-wheels
```

You can change the `--platform` in order to support different platforms as well
if needed.
